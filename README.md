# Virus Diagnosis Expert System (Prolog)

This is a simple Prolog expert system that diagnoses the likelihood of a virus infection based on patient symptoms, bio data, and recent contact history.

## How to run

1. Open SWI-Prolog
2. Load the file ( make sure you're in the same directory as *main.pl* ):
   ```prolog
   ?- [main].
3. Run the diagnosis:
    ```prolog
   ?- diagnosis_result.
